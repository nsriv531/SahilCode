# Exercise 5: Comprehensive List Exercise
# Create a function named `process_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input.
# The function should return a dictionary with the following keys and values:
# - `sum`: The sum of all numbers (use the `sum_array` function).
# - `average`: The average of all numbers (use the `average_array` function).
# - `max`: The maximum value in the list.
# - `min`: The minimum value in the list.
# 
# Write the `process_numbers` function and test it with different lists of numbers.
