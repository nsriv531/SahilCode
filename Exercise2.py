# Exercise 2: Addition and Subtraction Functions
# Extend the first exercise by creating two functions: `add` and `subtract`.
# The `add` function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, and return their sum.
# The `subtract` function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, and return the result of `a - b`.
# 
# Write both functions and test them with different values.
